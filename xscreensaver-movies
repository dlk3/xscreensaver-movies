#  A script that will play movie files as screensavers in xscreensaver.
#  Movies are played in random order and do not repeat until all movies
#  have been played.
#
#  To install on Fedora 30 Linux:
#  1) Make sure that you have the "mpv" application installed
#  2) Put this file in /usr/libexec/xscreensaver/ and make executable
#  3) Put the paths containing the movies you want to use into the
#     "movie_paths" variable below
#  4) Edit the ~/.xscreensaver file and add the following line at the
#     end of the "programs:" list found in that file:
#        "My Movies" xscreensaver-movies \n\
#  5) Configure xscreensaver to use this file

#  order, remembering what has been played across multiple invocations
#  of this script.  To do this we keep a list of the movies that have
#  yet to be played on disk in a config file.
