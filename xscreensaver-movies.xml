This Python script plays video files as a screen saver. The list of directories where this script looks for video files is set here.  This is a comma delimited string.  If there are any spaces in the string, xscreensaver-demo will mangle the string and prevent this script from working properly.  Example of a good string: "/video/directory_1,/directory_2,/directory3"
